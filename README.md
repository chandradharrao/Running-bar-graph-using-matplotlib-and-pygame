Running bar graph using matplotlib ,pandas and pygame

I used matplotlib to plot the graph for the top 10 most populous cities every year from 1575 to 2019.

Then saved the graph for every year and used pygame to blit the images to make the animation.

Create a folder named "plots" on you pc/laptop where the python file in located for it to place all the plots.
